  "articleBody": "Introduction Cisco SD-WAN provides with powerful tools to shape both routing behavior and how traffic flows through the overlay. At the core of this flexibility are two key policy types: Control Policies and Data Policies. Understanding the difference between them is crucial for designing scalable and optimized SD-WAN deployments.\nIn this post, we’ll explore down what each policy type does, how they differ, and when to use one over the other.\nCentralized and Localized Polices Policies are categorized based on where they are configured and applied, they could be Centralized and Localized policies. The Manager uses netconf/yang to send policy configuration.\nCentralized Policies\nConfigured on the Controller (vSmart) and pushed to a selected group of SD-WAN routers through Overlay Management Protocol (OMP). Includes:\nControl policies Data policies App-aware routing policies Localized Policies\nConfigured directly on the SD-WAN routers and only affect that specific device. Includes:\nLocal ACLs Route policies QoS settings What Are Control Policies? Control policies in Cisco SD-WAN are applied on the control plane - specifically, they define how routing information is exchanged between Controllers and SD-WAN routers.\nKey characteristics:\nApplied on Controllers Influence route advertisements and TLOC propagation Define what routes are accepted, modified, or rejected Typical use cases:\nCreate topologies (hub/spoke, partial mesh, etc) Controlling route leaks between VPNs Filtering or tagging OMP routes Think of control policies as a way to shape the SD-WAN topology itself by deciding which routes exist and where they are allowed to go.\nWhat Are Data Policies? Data policies, on the other hand, operate on the data plane. They define how actual traffic is handled.\nKey characteristics:\nAlso configured on the Controllers but applied on SD-WAN routers Operate at forwarding level, not related to route advertisements Can match on various fields: source/destination IPs, ports, applications, etc. Typical use cases:\nApplication-aware traffic steering Applying QoS classes Blocking certain types of traffic (for example, using ACL-style rules) Using an analogy: Control policies are the city planners deciding where roads are built, data policies are the traffic rules that govern how vehicles move through them.\nKey Differences at a Glance Feature Control Policy Data Policy Plane Control plane Data plane Applied on Controller Wan Edge Affects Route advertisements Actual traffic forwarding Common Use Cases Route filtering, TLOC mapping Traffic steering, QoS, ACLs Directionality Between controllers From controller to edge routers Policy Execution Order The following steps happen when a packet is passing through a WAN Edge router:\nLocal ingress policies, such as interface level ACLs and QoS settings, are applied first. These can filter packets and apply marking or re-marking for QoS.\nCentralized Application-Aware Routing is evaluated next. It makes forwarding decisions only between equal-cost paths already present in the routing table.\nThen, the centralized data policy is evaluated. It has the ability to override any forwarding decisions made by AAR.\nOnce policies are applied, the system performs routing and forwarding lookups to identify the appropriate egress interface.\nQueueing and scheduling mechanisms are applied to shape traffic according to QoS settings.\nFinally, the local egress policy is applied before the packet is placed on the wire.\nUnderstanding this order is key to avoiding misconfigurations and ensuring your policies behave as expected. A common mistake is unintentionally overriding an AAR routing decision by applying a centralized data policy that matches the same traffic and redirects it elsewhere.\nWhen to Use What Choosing between control and data policies depends on what problem you’re solving:\nWant to limit which routes are shared between sites? → Use a control policy. Need to steer certain applications over MPLS or DIA? → That’s a data policy job. Trying to prevent route advertisement loops or control inter-VPN leakage? → Control policy. Looking to prioritize VoIP traffic or drop peer-to-peer file sharing? → Data policy. In many designs, both are used together. For example, a control policy might ensure only selected prefixes are reachable between sites, while a data policy handles how the matching traffic is prioritized and forwarded.\nConclusion Control and data policies serve distinct but complementary purposes in Cisco SD-WAN. One governs the topology and routing decisions, the other shapes how traffic moves through that topology.\nUnderstanding these differences allows you to build smarter and more efficient SD-WAN environments. Want to go deeper? Check out Cisco’s official docs on Control Policies and Data Policies.\nAlso, check out my deep dive on Application-Aware Routing, and learn how SD-WAN can automatically move traffic to best performing paths and guarantee a good user experience.\n",

<h2 id="policy-execution-order">Policy Execution Order<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#policy-execution-order">#</a></h2>
<p>The following steps happen when a packet is passing through a WAN Edge router:</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/policies2.png"></p>
<p><strong>Local ingress policies</strong>, such as interface level ACLs and QoS settings, are applied first. These can filter packets and apply marking or re-marking for QoS.</p>
<p><strong>Centralized Application-Aware Routing</strong> is evaluated next. It makes forwarding decisions only between equal-cost paths already present in the routing table.</p>
<p>Then, the <strong>centralized data policy</strong> is evaluated. It has the ability to override any forwarding decisions made by AAR.</p>
<p>Once policies are applied, the system performs <strong>routing and forwarding</strong> lookups to identify the appropriate egress interface.</p>
<p><strong>Queueing and scheduling</strong> mechanisms are applied to shape traffic according to QoS settings.</p>
<p>Finally, the <strong>local egress policy</strong> is applied before the packet is placed on the wire.</p>
<p>Understanding this order is key to avoiding misconfigurations and ensuring your policies behave as expected. A common mistake is unintentionally overriding an AAR routing decision by applying a centralized data policy that matches the same traffic and redirects it elsewhere.</p>
<h2 id="when-to-use-what">When to Use What<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#when-to-use-what">#</a></h2>
<p>Choosing between control and data policies depends on <strong>what problem you’re solving</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Want to <strong>limit which routes are shared</strong> between sites? → Use a <strong>control policy</strong>.</li>
<li>Need to <strong>steer certain applications</strong> over MPLS or DIA? → That’s a <strong>data policy</strong> job.</li>
<li>Trying to <strong>prevent route advertisement loops</strong> or control inter-VPN leakage? → Control policy.</li>
<li>Looking to <strong>prioritize VoIP traffic</strong> or drop peer-to-peer file sharing? → Data policy.</li>
</ul>
<p>In many designs, both are used together. For example, a control policy might ensure only selected prefixes are reachable between sites, while a data policy handles how the matching traffic is prioritized and forwarded.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#conclusion">#</a></h2>
<p>Control and data policies serve distinct but complementary purposes in Cisco SD-WAN. One governs the <strong>topology and routing decisions</strong>, the other shapes <strong>how traffic moves</strong> through that topology.</p>
<p>Understanding these differences allows you to build smarter and more efficient SD-WAN environments. Want to go deeper?
