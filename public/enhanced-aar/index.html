AAR Limitations
Before diving into EAAR, let&rsquo;s understand why it was created.
The current AAR implementation measures the path quality using BFD, sending probes at a defined interval (1s by default). Loss, latency and jitter are derived from those packets and these values are placed into rotating buckets to calculate an average tunnel health metric. This process would typically take between 10 to 60 minutes and with some configuration tweaks we could achieve times of 2 to 10 mins.">

While AAR has been a fundamental capability for years, the evolution of networking brought new ideas to enhance its effectiveness. This led to the introduction of Enhanced Application Aware Routing (EAAR).\nAAR Limitations Before diving into EAAR, let’s understand why it was created.\nThe current AAR implementation measures the path quality using BFD, sending probes at a defined interval (1s by default). Loss, latency and jitter are derived from those packets and these values are placed into rotating buckets to calculate an average tunnel health metric. This process would typically take between 10 to 60 minutes and with some configuration tweaks we could achieve times of 2 to 10 mins.\nFor those networks that require faster detection, some challenges arise:\nLowering the hello interval to less than 1s affects the device’s tunnel scale Lowering bfd multiplier and poll intervals could lead to false positives, switching traffic even with transient network conditions. Switch traffic back and forth, there is no mechanism to determine if a transport is stable again after a network degradation event. Enhanced AAR So, what is EAAR and how it improves its predecessor?\nIn a nutshell these are the advantages:\nImproves performance measurements using inline data. In other words, the data plane packets are used to measure loss, latency and jitter. Steer traffic in seconds rather than minutes Dampening implemented for stability purposes, ensuring transports are stable before forwarding traffic through them. More accurate measurements of loss, latency and jitter Taking a deeper look When EAAR is enabled, data packets will be used to measure loss, latency and jitter. Let’s understand the key differences:\nLoss measurement The SD-WAN routers will use inline data along with IPSEC sequence numbers to measure loss.\nThere is an in-built mechanism that allows the routers to determine if the loss is local to the router (local loss - typically due to QoS drops) or external to the router (WAN loss - any packet loss outside the router). To calculate the local loss, the router will determine the amount of packets it generated against the amount of packets that actually were sent. To get the WAN loss, peer SD-WAN routers will report the amount of packets received and will use BFD (Path Monitor TLVs) to share this information back to the originating router. This is done per tunnel.\nUp to this point, there is an important improvement in how loss measurement is done, however, this could be further improved by leveraging per queue loss measurements. To achieve this, we need to associate an SLA class with an App Probe Class. Let’s see an example.\nWith this App Probe Class, the router will use (and generate BFD) packets with DSCP 18, mimicking less important traffic that will be subject to different rules and paths on the local and external routers. This will provide a more accurate measurement of loss for this type of traffic.\nIf there is no inline data, BFD is used to get measurements.\nNote If using GRE, per queue measurement is not available.\nHere is a visual to better understand how loss will be measured depending on multiple factors\nEncapsulation App Probe Class Measurement type Public tunnels Private Tunnels IPsec Yes Per SLA Total WAN loss + local loss per queue WAN loss per queue + local loss per queue IPsec No All SLAs Total WAN loss + total local loss Total WAN loss + total local loss GRE - All SLAs Total WAN loss + total local loss Total WAN loss + total local loss Latency To measure latency, the router will simply calculate the time taken to send and receive packets between source and destination devices. Inline data is used and it can get to App Probe granularity.\nJitter Another worth mentioning change is that the jitter is computed per direction (receive or transmit). The jitter is computed at the receiver and reported to the sender using BFD TLVs. Inline data is used and BFD is the fallback mechanism if no data traffic is available.\nSLA Dampening One of the benefits of EAAR is steering traffic in seconds rather than minutes, but what would happen if there are transient network conditions causing the transports to not meet the sla every few minutes? Traffic would be constantly switching between transports which is not a desirable scenario and the reason why dampening was introduced.\nThe general idea is that when a transport link goes out of compliance, traffic is rerouted to an alternate path. Once the transport becomes compliant again, the device does not immediately move traffic back. Instead, it starts a timer to ensure the link remains stable for a specified period before reusing it.\nIn the end, dampening helps prevent unnecessary traffic shifts, which could negatively impact performance due to transport instability\nConfiguring EAAR To enable EAAR we have three predefined options:\nMode Poll Interval Poll Multiplier Dampening Multiplier Aggressive 10s 6 (10s-60s) 120 (20 mins) Moderate 60s 5 (60s-300s) 40 (40 mins) Conservative 300s 6 (300s-1800s) 12 (60 mins) Note To use custom timers, configuration needs to be done through CLI templates.\nThe fundamental principle behind EAAR is similar to AAR in that they will both use rotating buckets and calculate average values for loss, latency and jitter. With the Aggressive mode, traffic would take between 10-60 seconds to shift, depending on how severe the impairment is. The dampening window (poll interval x dampening multiplier) is 20 minutes, meaning that before switching traffic back to a transport, it needs to be stable for 20 minutes.\nIn my lab, I am using Configuration Groups, however this is available through templates as well.\nYou could decide to use a variable, instead of a global value, to account for devices that wouldn’t be running EAAR. In this case, EAAR enabled devices will use traditional AAR with non-enabled EAAR devices.\nThe following config is added to the devices:\nbfd enhanced-app-route enable bfd enhanced-app-route pfr-poll-interval 10000 bfd enhanced-app-route pfr-multiplier 6 bfd sla-dampening enable bfd sla-dampening multiplier 120 Let’s see how it works\nDemo In my lab, I use Manager 20.16.1 and my devices are running 17.13.1a\nNote The minimum version required is 20.12/17.12\nLet’s start with some verifications after pushing the configuration.\nTo check the configured timers and multipliers\nBR10#show sdwan app-route params Enhanced Application-Aware routing Config: :Enabled Poll interval: :10000 Poll multiplier: :6 App route Poll interval: :120000 Poll multiplier: :5 SLA dampening Config: :Enabled Multiplier: :120 To verify what sessions are using EAAR, look for the FLAGS column\nBR10#show sdwan bfd sessions alt SOURCE TLOC REMOTE TLOC DST PUBLIC DST PUBLIC SYSTEM IP SITE ID STATE COLOR COLOR SOURCE IP IP PORT ENCAP BFD-LD FLAGS UPTIME ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 1.1.1.20 200 up biz-internet biz-internet 30.1.10.2 30.1.20.2 12406 ipsec 20006 EAAR 0:00:20:31 1.1.1.20 200 up mpls mpls 30.2.10.2 30.2.20.2 12366 ipsec 20002 EAAR 0:00:20:38 1.1.1.20 200 up private1 private1 30.3.10.2 30.3.20.2 12366 ipsec 20003 EAAR 0:00:20:37 To get more details about a specific tunnel.\nBR10#show sdwan app-route stats summary Generating output, this might take time, please wait ... app-route statistics 30.1.10.2 30.1.20.2 ipsec 12386 12406 remote-system-ip 1.1.1.20 local-color biz-internet remote-color biz-internet sla-class-index 0,1,2 fallback-sla-class-index None enhanced-app-route Enabled sla-dampening-index None app-probe-class-list None mean-loss 0.000 mean-latency 0 mean-jitter 0 TOTAL AVERAGE AVERAGE TX DATA RX DATA IPV6 TX IPV6 RX INDEX PACKETS LOSS LATENCY JITTER PKTS PKTS DATA PKTS DATA PKTS ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 1 64 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 2 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 3 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 4 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 5 64 0 0 0 0 0 0 0 Notice that there is no traffic between my devices, thus the total packet count on each bucket is low.\nSame information is available through the Manager’s UI, using the Real Time dashboard and using the App Routes Statistics Device Option.\nScenario 1 Conclusions App probes offer higher benefits if there are private transports that offer quality of service The total number of samples increase dramatically\n",

  <div class="post-content"><h2 id="introduction">Introduction<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#introduction">#</a></h2>
<p>In my previous <a href="/demystifying-aar-1-3-the-foundations">series of posts</a>, I explored <strong>Application Aware Routing (AAR)</strong> in depth, a key SD-WAN technology that steers traffic over best-performing paths. While AAR has been a fundamental capability for years, the evolution of networking brought new ideas to enhance its effectiveness. This led to the introduction of <strong><em>Enhanced</em> Application Aware Routing (EAAR)</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="aar-limitations">AAR Limitations<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#aar-limitations">#</a></h2>
<p>Before diving into EAAR, let&rsquo;s understand why it was created.</p>
<p>The current AAR implementation measures the path quality using BFD, sending probes at a defined interval (1s by default). Loss, latency and jitter are derived from those packets and these values are placed into rotating buckets to calculate an average tunnel health metric. This process would typically take between 10 to 60 minutes and with some configuration tweaks we could achieve times of 2 to 10 mins.</p>
<p>For those networks that require faster detection, some challenges arise:</p>
<ul>
<li>Lowering the hello interval to less than 1s affects the device&rsquo;s tunnel scale</li>
<li>Lowering bfd multiplier and poll intervals could lead to false positives, switching traffic even with transient network conditions.</li>
<li>Switch traffic back and forth, there is no mechanism to determine if a transport is stable again after a network degradation event.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="enhanced-aar">Enhanced AAR<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#enhanced-aar">#</a></h2>
<p><em>So, what is EAAR and how it improves its predecessor?</em></p>
<p>In a nutshell these are the advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>Improves performance measurements using <u>inline data</u>. In other words, the data plane packets are used to measure loss, latency and jitter.</li>
<li>Steer traffic in <u>seconds</u> rather than minutes</li>
<li>Dampening implemented for <u>stability</u> purposes, ensuring transports are stable before forwarding traffic through them.</li>
<li>More <u>accurate measurement</u>s of loss, latency and jitter</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="taking-a-deeper-look">Taking a deeper look<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#taking-a-deeper-look">#</a></h3>
<p>When EAAR is enabled, data packets will be used to measure loss, latency and jitter. Let&rsquo;s understand the key differences:</p>
<h4 id="loss-measurement">Loss measurement<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#loss-measurement">#</a></h4>
<p>The SD-WAN routers will use inline data along with IPSEC sequence numbers to measure loss.</p>
<p>There is an in-built mechanism that allows the routers to determine if the loss is local to the router (<strong>local loss</strong> - typically due to QoS drops) or external to the router (<strong>WAN loss</strong> - any packet loss outside the router). To calculate the local loss, the router will determine the amount of packets it generated against the amount of packets that actually were sent. To get the WAN loss, peer SD-WAN routers will report the amount of packets received and will use BFD (Path Monitor TLVs) to share this information back to the originating router. This is done per tunnel.</p>
<p>Up to this point, there is an important improvement in how loss measurement is done, however, this could be further improved by leveraging per queue loss measurements. To achieve this, we need to associate an SLA class with an App Probe Class. Let&rsquo;s see an example.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/app-probe.png"></p>
<p>With this App Probe Class, the router will use (and generate BFD) packets with DSCP 18, mimicking less important traffic that will be subject to different rules and paths on the local and external routers. This will provide a more accurate measurement of loss for this type of traffic.</p>
<p>If there is no inline data, BFD is used to get measurements.</p>
<p><strong>Note</strong> If using GRE, per queue measurement is not available.</p>
<p>Here is a visual to better understand how loss will be measured depending on multiple factors</p>
<table>
  <thead>
      <tr>
          <th>Encapsulation</th>
          <th>App Probe Class</th>
          <th>Measurement type</th>

      <tr>
          <td>IPsec</td>
          <td>Yes</td>

      <tr>
          <td>IPsec</td>
          <td>No</td>

          <td>Total WAN loss + total local loss</td>
      </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<h4 id="latency">Latency<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#latency">#</a></h4>
<p>To measure latency, the router will simply calculate the time taken to send and receive packets between source and destination devices. Inline data is used and it can get to App Probe granularity.</p>
<h4 id="jitter">Jitter<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#jitter">#</a></h4>
<p>Another worth mentioning change is that the jitter is computed per direction (receive or transmit). The jitter is computed at the receiver and reported to the sender using BFD TLVs. Inline data is used and BFD is the fallback mechanism if no data traffic is available.</p>
<h3 id="sla-dampening">SLA Dampening<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#sla-dampening">#</a></h3>
<p>One of the benefits of EAAR is steering traffic in seconds rather than minutes, but what would happen if there are transient network conditions causing the transports to not meet the sla every few minutes? Traffic would be constantly switching between transports which is not a desirable scenario and the reason why dampening was introduced.</p>
<p>The general idea is that when a transport link goes out of compliance, traffic is rerouted to an alternate path. Once the transport becomes compliant again, the device <strong>does not</strong> immediately move traffic back. Instead, it starts a timer to ensure the link remains stable for a specified period before reusing it.</p>
<p>In the end, dampening helps prevent unnecessary traffic shifts, which could negatively impact performance due to transport instability</p>
<h2 id="configuring-eaar">Configuring EAAR<a hidden class="anchor" aria-hidden="true" href="#configuring-eaar">#</a></h2>
<p>To enable EAAR we have three predefined options:</p>
<table>
  <thead>
      <tr>
          <th>Mode</th>
          <th>Poll Interval</th>
          <th>Poll Multiplier</th>
          <th>Dampening Multiplier</th>
      </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
      <tr>
          <td>Aggressive</td>
          <td>10s</td>
          <td>6 (10s-60s)</td>
          <td>120 (20 mins)</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>Moderate</td>
          <td>60s</td>
          <td>5 (60s-300s)</td>
          <td>40  (40 mins)</td>
      </tr>
      <tr>
          <td>Conservative</td>
          <td>300s</td>
          <td>6 (300s-1800s)</td>
          <td>12  (60 mins)</td>
      </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>
<p><strong>Note</strong> To use custom timers, configuration needs to be done through CLI templates.</p>
<p>The fundamental principle behind EAAR is similar to AAR in that they will both use rotating buckets and calculate average values for loss, latency and jitter. With the <em>Aggressive</em> mode, traffic would take between 10-60 seconds to shift, depending on how severe the impairment is. The dampening window (poll interval x dampening multiplier) is 20 minutes, meaning that before switching traffic back to a transport, it needs to be stable for 20 minutes.</p>
<p>In my lab, I am using Configuration Groups, however this is <a href="https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/routers/sdwan/configuration/policies/ios-xe-17/policies-book-xe/m-enhanced-application-aware-routing.html#configure-enhanced-application-aware-routing-using-a-feature-template-in-cisco-sd-wan-manager">available through templates</a> as well.</p>
<p><img loading="lazy" src="/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/eaar-config-groups.png"></p>
<p>You could decide to use a variable, instead of a global value, to account for devices that wouldn&rsquo;t be running EAAR. In this case, EAAR enabled devices will use traditional AAR with non-enabled EAAR devices.</p>
<p>The following config is added to the devices:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"><code class="language-fallback" data-lang="fallback"><span style="display:flex;"><span>  bfd enhanced-app-route enable
