      <title>Improving my SD-WAN Assistant - Multiple agents</title>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In my &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/building-my-first-sd-wan-ai-assistant-with-langchain/&#34;&gt;last post&lt;/a&gt;, I created a Cisco SD-WAN assistant to help me run NWPI traces and troubleshoot the network. The interaction with the assistant required the user to answer questions until receiving information about a particular flow and potential problems. In this post my goal is to use multiple agents and see if I can get to the same conclusion with less human interaction. Repository can be found &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/aruiz-p/sdwan-langgraph&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;getting-started&#34;&gt;Getting Started&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To achieve this, I will use &lt;a href=&#34;https://langchain-ai.github.io/langgraph/&#34;&gt;LangGraph&lt;/a&gt; officially defined as:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It has been a while since I wanted to hop on to the LLM train and learn how to use one of the popular frameworks. A few months back, I saw a great &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.ciscolive.com/on-demand/on-demand-library.html?search=jesus&amp;amp;search=jesus#/session/1707505627331001pilj&#34;&gt;Cisco Live presentation&lt;/a&gt; by my good friend Jesus, and it gave me the determination I needed to finally dive deeper into the topic.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Since then, I have been doing research and thinking about a nice use case for me to put as objective of my learning process. After considering different options, I decided to build an SD-WAN AI assistant that could help me troubleshoot an SD-WAN issue. Taking advantage of the available tools, I decided that my assistant would be an expert on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/network-wide-path-insights-an-introduction/&#34;&gt;Net&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/network-wide-path-insights-an-introduction/&#34;&gt;work Wide Path Insights&lt;/a&gt; functionality.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Tracking SD-WAN incidents with Service Now</title>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As networks evolve to provide better user experience and new technologies to manage the network are introduced, maintaining everything running smoothly has become increasingly difficult. One of the critical responsibilities of the operations team is tracking problems happening all over the network. Identifying them is just the beginning, then they need to be logged and driven to resolution. Multiply the amount of actions per incident and you have enough to keep your IT team busy all day long!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Simplifying AAR: 3/3 Fallback to best path</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/simplifying-aar-3-3-fallback-to-best-path/</link>

      <description>&lt;h2 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For the final post of this series, let&amp;rsquo;s explore the remaining option to handle traffic when SLA is not met: &lt;em&gt;Fallback to best path&lt;/em&gt;. It was introduced on 20.5/17.5 and it provides more flexibility and enhanced path selection compared to the other options. Let&amp;rsquo;s understand why it was created.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&#34;motivation&#34;&gt;Motivation&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With the &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/demystifying-aar-understanding-different-scenarios/&#34;&gt;previous methods&lt;/a&gt;, traffic would either:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be dropped - Rarely used, specific use cases that apply to a small amount of environments.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Be load balanced on the available paths - Widely used, however traffic could be using the worst performing path.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Take the following example&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Think about routing technologies out there, most of them got really good at reacting to link failures and power outages with protocols like OSPF LFA/FRR, EIGRP feasible successor, BGP PIC, etc. However, they fall short when it comes to addressing issues like network performance degradation during brownouts caused by factors such as power fluctuations or link congestion. These scenarios introduce new challenges for which traditional routing protocols lack adequate tools. This is where Application Aware Routing comes to save the day.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Welcome back to the second installment of my series on Application Aware Routing (AAR). In my &lt;a href=&#34;http://localhost:1313/demystifying-aar-1-3-the-foundations/&#34;&gt;previous post&lt;/a&gt;, we discussed the essential concepts of Bidirectional Forwarding Detection (BFD) and Service Level Agreements (SLAs), laying the foundation for understanding how AAR optimizes network performance based on application requirements. We also briefly touched on tha AAR configuration with a simple example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Now, we continue by digging deeper on different AAR configurations, more specifically we will concentrate on &lt;em&gt;Strict/Drop&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Backup SLA Preferred Color&lt;/em&gt; behaviors.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h3 id=&#34;motivation-the-typical-crisis-scenario&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Motivation:&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;The typical crisis scenario&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Imagine starting your day in the networking team, only to be bombarded with complaints about the main internal application being down. You start investigating. Where is the problem located? Is it isolated or affecting multiple places? When did the problem start? What is the impact?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Next, you get someone to help you verify the basics. DHCP and DNS work. Gateway is reachable. Connectivity to other targets on the same DC is intermittent! It is starting to get weird&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;</description>
